# Packing IPs for disstribution
Each IP shall have its own public GH repo for development. The repo shall have a CI that creates a compressed tarball after the structure outlined [here](ip_package.md) and added to the releases.
- The release's tag should be named as followed:
```<ip_name>-<version>```
- The tarball in the release should be named:
```default.tar.gz```

A cli will be developed to enable anyone to submit an IP for distribution.

- `ipm ip create new_ip.yaml`
- `ipm ip update new_ip.yaml`

Note: Internally the repo url is used as an IP ID.

`ipm` team will perform set of sanity checks to ensure the quality of the submmitted IP. This checker shall ensure:

- The correctness of the directory structure
- The existance of all file types as per the IP type.
- That the IP is LVS clean
- That the IP is DRC clean
